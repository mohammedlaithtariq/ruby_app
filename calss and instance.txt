class info 
#class method



def self .name  	

   "my mane is mohammed "

end 


#instance methode 



def car

  "my car is gt "


end 


when i want to call a class method  like:

info.name   =>  "my mane is mohammed "



so if i want to call a instance  method i shoud use  a object like:

i=info.new 

i.car =>  "my car is gt "
or 

info.new.car  =>  "my car is gt "


thats mean 

class method : can access .class name 

instance methode : can access by object
